== Day 18

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

My initial idea failed. So i started reading up on the theory. Ended up implementing 
Gauss's area formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) and 
Pick's (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem) theorem.

=== What did I learn

Learned a few things about geometry today. In particular: 

* Gauss's area formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) and 
* Pick's (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem) theorem.
