== Day 15

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* defaultdict (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)

=== Main idea

Nothing special today. Quite straight forward puzzle. 

For the second part I created a `defaultdict` containing two list. One 
containing the lens labels and one containing the focal length. Second part worked on the first try ðŸ˜Ž.

=== What did I learn


Run using:
`$ python day_15.py --help`
