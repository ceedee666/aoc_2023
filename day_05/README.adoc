== Day 05

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* itertools (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)
=== Main idea

For part 1 I used simple ranges in Python. Unfortunately, the brute force approach would not work for part 2.
With some reading of possible ideas I implemented a recoursive solution for part 2. Finally, a very nice solution. 

=== What did I learn

Learnd about the batched function in itertools.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_05.py --help`
