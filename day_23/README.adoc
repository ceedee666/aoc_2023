== Day 23

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* copy from copy (https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html)
* defaultdict and deque from collections (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)

=== Main idea

Nothing to special for today. Again breadth fist search for part 1. 
The reversal of the condition trick me. I needed two tries to get it right. 

=== What did I learn

Run using:
`$ python day_23.py --help`
