== Day 24

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* combinations from itertools (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations)
* numpy (https://numpy.org/)

=== Main idea

Solved the first part using numpy. 
No idea for the second part. Checking reddit I learned about Z3. Used z3 to solve part 2.

=== What did I learn

Learned about Z3.

Run using:
`$ python day_24.py --help`
