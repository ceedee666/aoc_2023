== Day 17

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* defaultdict (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)
* heapq (https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html)

=== Main idea

Hard day for me today. I immediatly knew this shuld be solved using Dijkstras algorithm. However, I really hard time implementing it.
Tried several different approaches until I finally got it!

=== What did I learn

After checking some of the solution on reddit I learned the trick to represent the directions as a special list of tuples.
The reverse directions are keept two steps apart. Checking for reverse direction is as simple as `+2 %4` with this approach.

Run using:
`$ python day_17.py --help`
