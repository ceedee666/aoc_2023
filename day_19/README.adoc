== Day 19

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Quite messy solution today.

I initially generated a solution using dataclasses for the parts and lambda functions for the rules. This did not work at all for part 2. 
But I liked the approach and kept it. 

For part 2 i build a recursion based on the intervals. I allwas struggle with this kind of recursions.

=== What did I learn

Learned about closures and lamda fuctions in Python for my first solution. 


Run using:
