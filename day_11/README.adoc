== Day 11

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* combinations from itertools (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations)

=== Main idea

For part 1 I initially just added empty lines and colums. Also I was already thinking about
simply calculating the result. For part 2 i just refectored the code to calculate the distance.


=== What did I learn

Did not read the instructions well enough. If a line repeates 100 times I just need to add 99 new lines. 
Once I realized this bug part 2 was easy as well. 

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_11.py --help
