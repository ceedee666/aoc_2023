== Day 16

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* defaultdict and deque for the collections library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)

=== Main idea

Again nothing special today. Most complex part was to implement the logic how
beams are influenced by the different tiles. 

For cecking which tiles are energized by the beam I implemented a breadth-fist-search using
a `deque`. Pretty happy that I got this right on the first try. Years of Advent Of Code start to pay off ðŸ¤£.

For the second part just run the algorithm with all possible start configurations. 

=== What did I learn

Run using:
`$ python day_16.py --help`
