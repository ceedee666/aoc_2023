== Day 12

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* cache from the functools lib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cache)

=== Main idea

Had to use some ideas from reddit today. 
The main idea is to recursiely collect possible sollutions. Whenever the 
char in the pattern is `?` it is replaced by `.` and `#` and the resulting 
pattern is checked. 

For each `#` it is checked if we are currently in a group. If yes, check next char. 
The last letter of the pattern needs special handling. 
For each `.` it is chekced if the previuous group can be closed. If yes, it is removed from the list of numbers. 
Otherwise, the next char is checked.

=== What did I learn

Run using:
`$ python day_12.py --help
