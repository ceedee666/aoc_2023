== Day 14

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* count form itertools (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.count)

=== Main idea

My initial idea worked really nice. And it also was a good start for part 2. 
The idea is to split the strings and sort them using a key function. Part 1 
was pretty easy with this approach. For part 2 I mixed up east and west. Then I 
couldn't get the calculation of the cycle right. Just used brute force and 
`cache` from `functools`. Took forever for part 2.

After that I refactored the solution to get the cycle right. Now it runs in 0.7s 
on my machineâ„¢.

=== What did I learn

* could apply the transpose approach from yesterday. 
* how to use `count` form the `itertools` together with `for` instead of a `while` loop.
