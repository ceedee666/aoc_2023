== Day 20

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* Counter und deque from collections

=== Main idea

For part 1 keep track of the in and outputs for each gate. Also for each pulse keep track 
of the source and the target. Mess up the data structure a litte which made my code quite messy. For 
example, I represent a pulse with `(value, target, source)` why not `(value, source, target)`?

For part 2 I count how many cycles are needed until the single inputs to the nand-gate just before
rx (named lb in my case) turn to 1. The number of button presses is simply the product of these values. 


=== What did I learn


Run using:
`$ python day_20.py --help`
