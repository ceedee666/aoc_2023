== Day 02

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* math (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)

=== Main idea
Today was straigtforward. I used a tuple to repsesnet the games. Each round ist a map in the list of rounds.
On this basis I tried to implement simple functions to filter the data. Only the parsing of the 
input data is not nicely functional. 

=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_02.py --help`
