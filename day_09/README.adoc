== Day 09

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Nothing special today. Just implemented the instructions of the puzzle. 
Part 2 was easy with my implementation. Just calculate an additional value. 

=== What did I learn

Was first starting to read about mathematical sequences. Then I decided just to try 
the naive implementation. Sometimes it is good not to overthink things.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_09.py --help
