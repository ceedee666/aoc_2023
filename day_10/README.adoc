== Day 10

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* deque from collections (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)  

=== Main idea

For part 1 I manually repaced the S with the correct shape and did a deepth first search. 
For part 2 I counted the number of times a ray from a shape would cross a pipe. If the number is off it is 
inside the loop, otherwise it is outside.

=== What did I learn

I learnd that counting the number of times a ray crosses the boundaries of a shaope
can be used to determine if a point is inside the shape or outside.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_10.py --help
