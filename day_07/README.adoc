== Day 03

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)
* itertools (https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)

=== Main idea

I first tried to solve today using data classes. Got stuck on the second part. 
Then I got the idea to just use the counter. Led to a much simpler solution. 

=== What did I learn

Learned a lot about dataclasses and `__eq__`, `__lt__` and `__hash__`. Although it was not needed in the end. 

In addition it got the nice idea to use sorted list representation of the counter values and the usage of 
`map` together with `str.split` from other users solutions.  

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_07.py --help
